Welcome to my Java learning repository!

This repo is a collection of Java programs that I’m writing as part of my daily learning and coding practice. My goal is to **track my progress**, improve step by step, and also **help others** who are starting their Java journey from the basics.

## 📘 What’s Covered So Far

Right now, I’ve completed topics up to:

- ✅ Basic Java Syntax
- 🧮 Operators & Expressions
- ⚖️ Conditionals ( if, else, switch-case)
- 🔄 Loops & Nested Loops (for, while, do-while)
- 📦 Packages & Import Statements
- 🧩 Methods (Definition, Calling, Parameters, Return Types)

> 📌 For each topic, I’m adding **multiple practice codes** so that others can understand better and practice too.  
> More topics like arrays, functions, and OOP will be added as I learn them.
